In Oracle, Primary key is the column which has unique values, and it cannot be null.
In a table, there can be only one primary key column and we can apply on multiple columns only once.

1> To see all tables which is exist in currnrt database : 
     SELECT OBJECT_NAME FROM USER_OBJECTS WHERE OBJECT_TYPE ='TABLE';
     
2> To see all tables which is exist in whole database :
     SELECT owner, table_name FROM all_tables;
     
3> To see all columns name from table(table name is case-sensitive like CUSTOMER) :
    SELECT COLUMN_NAME from user_tab_columns where TABLE_NAME='CUSTOMER';

4> To create table with primary key : 
   CREATE TABLE customer(id number(10) NOT NULL,name varchar2(50),city varchar2(50), CONSTRAINT customers_pk PRIMARY KEY (id));
   
5> Insert value in customer table : 
     Insert into customer values(1,'ram','ayodhya');

6> To Disable primary key in customer table : 
     ALTER TABLE customer DISABLE CONSTRAINT customers_pk ;
   
7> To Enable primary key in customer table :
     ALTER TABLE customer  ENABLE CONSTRAINT customers_pk; 

8> To Drop primary key in customer table :
     ALTER TABLE customer DROP CONSTRAINT customers_pk ; 
  
9> To Add primary key in customer table :  customer(table name),customers_pk(primary key column name)
     ALTER TABLE customer ADD CONSTRAINT customers_pk PRIMARY KEY(id);  

10> To add primary key on multiple column but once only.
     ALTER TABLE student ADD CONSTRAINT student_pk PRIMARY KEY (id,name);
   
11> To see in which column of table, primary key applied or its exist or not : CUSTOMER(table name should be capital)
     SELECT cols.table_name, cols.column_name, cols.position, cons.status, cons.owner
     FROM all_constraints cons, all_cons_columns cols WHERE cols.table_name = 'CUSTOMER'
     AND cons.constraint_type = 'P' AND cons.constraint_name = cols.constraint_name AND cons.owner = cols.owner
     ORDER BY cols.table_name, cols.position;
    
12> To see constraint name(Primary key) in a table :  CUSTOMER(table name should be capital)
     SELECT * FROM user_cons_columns WHERE table_name = 'CUSTOMER';
