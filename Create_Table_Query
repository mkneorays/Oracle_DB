1> To create table like CUSTOMER : 
    CREATE TABLE customer( id number(10) NOT NULL,name varchar2(10) NOT NULL, city varchar2(10) ); 
    
2> To CREATE TABLE Example with primary key : 
    CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id number(10) NOT NULL, customer_name varchar2(50) NOT NULL,city varchar2(50),  
    CONSTRAINT customers_pk PRIMARY KEY (customer_id));
    
NOTE : A primary key is a single field or combination of fields that contains a unique record. 
       It must be filled. None of the field of primary key can contain a null value. A table can have only one primary key.
       
3>  Copying all columns of another table in new Table.Current table won't perform any constraints rules of existing table.
    CREATE TABLE newcustomers AS (SELECT *   FROM customers  WHERE customer_id < 5000);
