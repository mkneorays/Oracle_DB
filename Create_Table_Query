1> To create table like CUSTOMER : 
    CREATE TABLE customer( id number(10) NOT NULL,name varchar2(10) NOT NULL, city varchar2(10) ); 
    
2> To CREATE TABLE Example with primary key : 
    CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id number(10) NOT NULL, customer_name varchar2(50) NOT NULL,city varchar2(50),  
    CONSTRAINT customers_pk PRIMARY KEY (customer_id));
    
NOTE : A primary key is a single field or combination of fields that contains a unique record. 
       It must be filled. None of the field of primary key can contain a null value. A table can have only one primary key.
       
3> Copying all columns of another table in new Table.Current table won't perform any constraints rules of existing table.
   excluding constraints, keys, indexes, identity property and data rows.
    CREATE TABLE newcustomers AS (SELECT *   FROM customers  WHERE customer_id < 5000);  

4> To copy structure of the table not data nothing but rows only column name will create with blank table excluding
   constraints, keys, indexes, identity property and data rows.
    create table dept1 AS select * from departments where 1=2;
